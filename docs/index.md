## About this github repository
 - Standard matlab written in a non-object oriented way.
 - Code are to download SST product from PSL ftp; extract SST features from the SST product; compute cloudiness from SST cloud mask; and find cloudiness over ellipitcal features.


### Ongoing To-do list:
-[ ] check cross-SST wind variation and its correlation with the SST

-[ ] try computing coupling coefficients (or show the bin statistics between delta wind and delta SST)

-[ ] find correlation between SST and the temporal cloud fraction.
