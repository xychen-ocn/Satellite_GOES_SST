## About this github repository
 - Standard matlab written in a non-object oriented way.
 - Code are to download SST product from PSL ftp; extract SST features from the SST product; compute cloudiness from SST cloud mask; and find cloudiness over ellipitcal features.


## Ongoing To-do list:
-[ ] finalize feature centered analysis

-[ ] do feature identification in the time dimension to define duration of a feature.



## About this ongoing analysis

The analyses I am doing here are replicating the method in Park et al. (2006) and Desbiolles et al.(2021). [Provide links to both papers]

The former is based on feature detection and cloudiness over features are analyzed in a composite way in a transformed coordinate. 

The latter is based on probability distribution analysis and found that increased cloud cover preferentially occur over warm-to-cold SST gradients (or fronts) in the Mediterrane sea.
