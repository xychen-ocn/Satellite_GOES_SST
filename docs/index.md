# About this github repository
 - Standard matlab written in a non-object oriented way.
 - Code are to download SST product from PSL ftp; extract SST features from the SST product; compute cloudiness from SST cloud mask; and find cloudiness over ellipitcal features.


### 2. To-do list:
[] - check cross-SST wind variation and its correlation with the SST
[] - try computing coupling coefficients (or show the bin statistics between delta wind and delta SST)
[] - find correlation between SST and the temporal cloud fraction.


# About this ongoing analysis
## Background
### 1. Air-Sea Interaction at mesoscale and the coupling coefficients


## Methods
### 1. Feature identification


### 2. coordinate transformation
