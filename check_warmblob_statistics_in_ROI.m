% This script is used to check warm blobs in region of interest.
%

% use mouse to draw a box to find location of interest:
examine_region = [-53, -51; 13, 15.5];

% group warm blobs by large scale condition and get blobs whose centers are
% in the region of interest. 


% then separate the blobs detected in the day and during nighttime;

% compare the blob characteristics, are we getting more blobs and larger
% blobs at nighttime --> when there is less frequent cloud appearance;

% is the warm blob warmer in day compared to at night?? ()

% the effect only occurs in day time, interesting.
